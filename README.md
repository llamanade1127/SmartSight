You can view the dev log [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GICq8Y8Ee_ZvZsJ_RqBWfc6tYapGK1uIRdssab6R79Q/edit)


This Project was made using PlatformIO which is a extenstion of for VSCode that allows you to create and upload code to arduino products without having to use the actuall arduino IDE. 

So if you plan on making your own version and dont have PlatformIO setup, you can just use the arduino IDE.

For more info check out this document on how to make it yourself: COMING SOON
